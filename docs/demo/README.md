## Measured on the phone

Six knowledge questions with the default 1.5B model and the Vital Articles pack
(`npm run eval:device`, 2026-09-24): 6 of 6 answered correctly, all from retrieved
articles, about 10.6 s per answer (6.4 s to the first word, 17.5 tokens/s), 1.76 GB
peak memory. See [DEVICE_EVALUATION.md](../DEVICE_EVALUATION.md) to run it yourself.
