## Details

### 1. Android and GrapheneOS — PARTIAL
- Runs on a physical Android 16 phone (above), measured across 85 benchmark
  answers in one session (see 7 and 8).
- Not yet run on GrapheneOS. The design doesn't depend on Google services (see
  6), but that's not a substitute for a real GrapheneOS run.

### 2. 12 GB RAM — PASS
- Highest measured process peak in the benchmark: 5.07 GB (Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M).
  Qwen2.5-1.5B steady state is about 1.6 GB, Phi-3.5-mini about 3.1–3.8 GB.
- Only one generation model is loaded at a time. Loads and unloads are
  serialized so rapid model switching can't leave a second model in memory
  (`src/inference/LlamaEngine.ts`, tested in `LlamaEngine.test.ts`).
- Before loading, the app checks the model's estimated working set against free
  RAM and refuses with a clear message rather than crashing
  (`LlamaEngine.estimateFit`).

### 3. 50 GB storage — PASS
- Default install: about 1 GB of models (Qwen2.5-1.5B 0.99 GB, bge-small
  0.04 GB) plus a few MB of knowledge base.
- Every optional catalog model (Phi-3.5-mini, Qwen2.5-7B, LFM2.5-8B-A1B,
  Gemma 4 E4B) adds about 17.4 GB, and the Wikipedia Vital Articles knowledge
  pack 0.16 GB, for about 18.6 GB in total.
- Enforced before every download (`checkStorageForDownload`,
  `src/models/storageBudget.ts`, called from `ModelManager.downloadCatalogModel`):
  what BOAR already stores (models, knowledge packs, database) plus downloads in
  progress, a 1 GB reserve for the app itself and the new file must stay within
  `STORAGE_BUDGET_BYTES` (50 GB), and the phone must have the space free.
  Otherwise the download is refused with a message before any data is fetched.

### 4. Works offline once installed — PASS
- After the one-time first-run download, answering questions uses only the
  on-device model (llama.rn / llama.cpp) and the local SQLite knowledge base
  and packs.
- Recorded on the test phone with airplane mode on and Wi-Fi off: four queries,
  a follow-up and the knowledge pack answering
  ([demo/](demo/README.md), 2026-09-24).

### 5. No network requests during use — PASS
The only network code in the app (`src/`):
- `ModelManager.downloadCatalogModel` — model and knowledge-pack downloads,
  started by the setup wizard or an explicit Download tap.
- `src/services/modelBrowser.ts` — Hugging Face model search, only when the user
  searches.

Inference, retrieval, chat history, telemetry and evaluation make no network
calls. The APK holds `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` for those downloads
only.

Optional voice input (`modules/voice-input`) uses Android's system speech
recognizer with offline preferred (`EXTRA_PREFER_OFFLINE`). Whether it
recognizes offline depends on the phone's installed speech service; typing
always works.

### 6. No Google Play Services — PASS
- The release build's runtime dependencies contain no Play Services or Firebase
  (`./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath`).
- The development build does include `play-services-code-scanner`, pulled in
  by `expo-dev-launcher` (the dev client's QR scanner). That's development
  tooling only and absent from release builds.
- The app code never calls Google services.

### 7. Research beyond recall — PARTIAL
- A fixed 17-question evaluation set covers greeting, factual, explanation,
  comparison, synthesis, reasoning, retrieval-grounded and no-knowledge-base
  questions ([docs/EVAL_QUERIES.md](EVAL_QUERIES.md)).
- First real-device baseline, 2026-09-24: all 68 answers from the four
  configurations that loaded completed. Phi-3.5-mini gave the most complete
  comparisons and syntheses.
- Knowledge pack run, 2026-09-24: with the Wikipedia Vital Articles pack
  (49,832 articles), Qwen2.5-1.5B answered 6 of 6 factual, retrieval-grounded
  and no-built-in-knowledge questions correctly, each from retrieved articles
  (e.g. Napoleon's dates, which aren't in the built-in knowledge base).
- LFM2.5-8B-A1B (mixture of experts, ~1.5B active), 2026-09-24: 17 of 17
  completed at 14.8 tok/s median, the first model to get the RAM-budget
  question right, but 4 answers were lost to reasoning that used the whole
  token budget.
- Limitations seen: arithmetic errors (every model missed the RAM-budget
  question), invented citations, and 9 answers truncated by the 120-second step
  timeout.

### 8. Usable speed — PARTIAL
Median time per answer in the baseline (retrieval on, 512-token budget):

| Configuration | Median total | Median TTFT | Median tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 21 s | 13.6 s | 11.4 |
| Adaptive routing | 25 s | 14.1 s | 11.4 |
| Phi-3.5-mini | 73 s | 44.0 s | 4.0 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 107 s | 70.5 s | 2.7 |

Most of the wait is processing the retrieved context before the first token.
Since then retrieval sends 4 chunks instead of 6: in the knowledge pack run
Qwen2.5-1.5B averaged 10.6 s per answer (6.4 s to the first word, 17.5 tok/s),
on 6 questions rather than the full set.

### 9. Public repository — PASS
[github.com/rferrari/boar-app](https://github.com/rferrari/boar-app). Confirm
it's public at claim time (18).

### 10. Code, assets, dependencies, instructions — PASS
- Build and install: [README.md](../README.md) Quickstart,
  [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), `Makefile`, `eas.json`.
- Knowledge base: `assets/corpus/*.json`, committed. The Wikipedia Vital
  Articles pack is a [release asset](https://github.com/rferrari/boar-app/releases/tag/knowledge-pack-v1),
  built reproducibly with `npm run pack:build`
  ([docs/KNOWLEDGE_PACKS.md](KNOWLEDGE_PACKS.md)).
- Models: downloaded by the in-app setup wizard from the URLs in
  `src/models/manifest.ts`, which also records each file's size and SHA-256.
  Downloads are verified by size on the device; the URLs point to each
  repository's `main` branch rather than a pinned revision.

### 11. Models and datasets documented — PASS
[docs/MODELS.md](MODELS.md) and `src/models/manifest.ts`: every model and
knowledge pack with source, size, checksum and license. The knowledge base and
packs are Wikipedia-derived, CC BY-SA 4.0.

### 12. Real hardware at submission — OPEN
Re-run on a physical phone from the exact release build (18) right before
claiming.

### 13. Running within a few minutes — OPEN
Not yet timed from a clean install. The first run downloads about 1 GB, so
total time depends on the connection.

### 14. Assets or download instructions — PASS
The first-run setup wizard downloads every required model and optional
knowledge pack in the app. `scripts/setup-models.sh` plus
`plugins/withBundledModels.js` is an alternative that bundles models into the
APK (see [docs/MODELS.md](MODELS.md)).

### 15–17. Public demo and poidh submission — OPEN / PARTIAL
- Recorded: four clips and screenshots in [demo/](demo/README.md), showing
  airplane mode, a synthesis prompt, a follow-up and knowledge-pack facts.
- Still to do: post them on X or Farcaster with the repo link and a short
  explanation of the approach, then submit a screenshot and links to poidh.

### 18. Submitted version matches the repository — OPEN
Tag the release commit and publish the APK with its SHA-256 as a GitHub
release.

### 19. Not fraudulent, malicious or plagiarized — PASS
- Original code, MIT licensed ([LICENSE](../LICENSE)).
- Models and data are third-party, used under their licenses (Apache-2.0, MIT,
  CC BY-SA 4.0) and credited in [docs/MODELS.md](MODELS.md).

### 20. ">50% as good as internet + frontier models" — OPEN
Not measured yet. The on-device evaluation harness and device CLI
(`npm run eval:device`, [docs/EVAL_QUERIES.md](EVAL_QUERIES.md)) produce the
BOAR side. Still needed: reference answers from a frontier model with web
search, rubric scoring against them, and blind human spot checks, with every
raw file committed.

## Evidence

| Run | What | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `eval-2026-09-24T03-12-53-754Z` | Baseline: 17 queries × 5 configurations | [evidence/2026-09-24-baseline-5-configs](evidence/2026-09-24-baseline-5-configs/) |
| `eval-2026-09-24T05-42-38-163Z` | LFM2.5-8B-A1B, 17 queries | [evidence/2026-09-24-lfm2.5-8b-a1b](evidence/2026-09-24-lfm2.5-8b-a1b/) |
| `eval-2026-09-24T20-41-45-071Z` | Qwen2.5-1.5B with the Vital Articles pack, 6 queries | [evidence/2026-09-24-vital-articles-pack](evidence/2026-09-24-vital-articles-pack/) |

The `.jsonl` files are the raw per-answer records written on the phone; the
reports and answer sheets are generated from them (`npm run eval:summary`).
