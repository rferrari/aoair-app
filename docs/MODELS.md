# Models, indexes, and datasets

This file documents every offline asset the app ships with or depends on, per the
bounty's "clearly document the models, datasets, indexes, and other resources used"
requirement.

## Primary generation model — chosen

**[Phi-3.5-mini-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct)**
(Microsoft, **MIT license**), quantized GGUF from
**[bartowski/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-GGUF)**,
file `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` (~2.23GB, sha256 below).

- 3.8B params, dense, Q4_K_M quantization
- Chosen over Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct because Qwen's 3B GGUF ships under the restrictive
  `qwen-research` license (non-commercial/research-only), which is a poor fit for a
  public open-source bounty submission; Phi-3.5-mini's MIT license has no such
  restriction.
- Strong reasoning-per-parameter for its size (outperforms most 1–3B dense models on
  MMLU/GSM8K-style benchmarks per its model card), directly targeting the bounty's
  ">1B dense model" reasoning bar.
- Runs via `llama.cpp`/`llama.rn` on Android CPU, mmap-streamable so weights aren't
  fully pinned in RAM.
- **Upgrade path (not yet implemented)**: a proper MoE model (e.g. an Apache/MIT
  licensed variant in the Qwen1.5-MoE / OLMoE family, ~2–3B active params) for more
  world knowledge at similar active-param RAM/speed cost, once benchmarked on-device
  against this baseline.

## Embedding model — chosen

**[bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)** (BAAI, **MIT
license**), quantized GGUF from
**[CompendiumLabs/bge-small-en-v1.5-gguf](https://huggingface.co/CompendiumLabs/bge-small-en-v1.5-gguf)**,
file `bge-small-en-v1.5-q8_0.gguf` (~35MB, sha256 below).

- 33M params, well under the 300MB sub-budget, fast enough to stay resident alongside
  the primary LLM without meaningfully affecting the 12GB RAM budget.

## Local knowledge base / retrieval index

- **Lexical**: SQLite FTS5 virtual table (`chunks_fts`), built from the same source
  corpus as the vector index. See `src/rag/db.ts`.
- **Semantic**: brute-force cosine search over stored float32 embeddings
  (`chunk_embeddings` table). Fine at the corpus scale a phone can hold within the
  storage budget; revisit with a proper ANN index (e.g. quantized HNSW) only if
  corpus size makes brute-force too slow on-device.
- **Corpus source**: TBD — candidates are a curated Wikipedia/Wikidata subset or a
  domain-specific offline reference set, compressed and chunked ahead of time on a
  dev machine, then shipped as a pre-built SQLite DB (not built on-device).

## Verification

Every shipped asset is declared in `src/models/manifest.ts` with a `sha256` and
`sizeBytes`; `ModelManager` verifies presence and (on demand) checksum before the
app relies on it. `scripts/setup-models.sh` is the only place network access to
fetch these assets happens — it runs once, before offline use, with the device
online; the built app itself never makes network requests.
