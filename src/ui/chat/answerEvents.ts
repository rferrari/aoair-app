/**
 * Layered-answer contract between the answer pipeline (src/routing/answer.ts)
 * and the chat UI. Agreed with the chat UI owner; spec mirrored in
 * docs/ADAPTIVE_ROUTING.md §"Answer contract".
 *
 * One pipeline, one event stream, whatever the depth: every answer is a
 * sequence of AnswerEvents delivered through a single onEvent callback, all
 * tagged with the answerId of the answer() call that produced them, so the UI
 * can drop late events from an answer it already stopped or replaced.
 *
 * Tiers (depth, not model):
 *   instant — extractive: a sentence from a retrieved source, no LLM, <1s.
 *   fast    — the model the user picked ("Use"), over compressed sources.
 *   deep    — the optional large model (settings deepModelId), or the
 *             multi-pass "complete answer" pipeline when no deep model fits.
 *
 * Pure types (no runtime deps) so UI code and tests can import it freely.
