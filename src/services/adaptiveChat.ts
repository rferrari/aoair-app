/**
 * Adaptive routing Phase 9 — wires the router/executor (src/routing/,
 * Phases 3-4) into ordinary chat. This is the ONLY new integration point:
 * Deep Research Mode (src/services/orchestrator.ts) is completely
 * separate and untouched — this module is never called from that path.
 *
 * Legacy path: superseded by src/routing/answerService.ts (depth routing).
 * Feature-flagged (settings.ts's getAdaptiveRoutingEnabled, on by
 * default) and designed to fail safe: every external call here (disk
 * status, settings, RAM readout) is wrapped so a single failure degrades
 * gracefully rather than throwing, and the ONE thing this module cannot
 * protect against — executeRoutingPlan() itself throwing — is explicitly
 * the caller's (ChatScreen.tsx's) responsibility to catch and fall back to
 * the existing fixed-active-model path. A routing failure must never leave
 * the user without a response.
