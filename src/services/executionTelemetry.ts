/**
 * Phase 7 (docs/ADAPTIVE_ROUTING.md) — persistent, model-tagged execution
 * telemetry. Local/offline only (SQLite, same file as everything else in
 * rag/db.ts — never transmitted). This is the persistent source of truth;
 * src/services/telemetry.ts's in-memory QueryStats stays as a separate,
 * unmodified compatibility layer for the existing live Usage Stats display
 * — this module doesn't replace it, it's the new thing that survives a
 * reload/restart.
 *
 * Deliberately never stores the user's prompt or the generated response
 * text — this is engineering/debugging data (timing, model, task
 * classification), not a copy of conversation history.
 *
 * Row (de)serialization and export formatting live in executionTelemetry.
 * pure.ts (native-module-free, unit-tested); this file is just the
 * SQLite/file-system/sharing glue around it.
