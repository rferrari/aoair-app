 * Module-level (not component-local) download state, so it survives the
 * Settings screen unmounting/remounting — e.g. the user closes Settings
 * while a download is running, then reopens it later. Without this, a
 * previous version tracked download progress in ModelSetupScreen's local
 * React state: closing Settings meant losing track of the in-flight
 * download entirely, so reopening Settings showed a plain "Download"
 * button again (as if nothing were happening) even while the original
 * download was still writing to disk. Tapping "Download" again in that
 * state started a SECOND concurrent download to the same destination file
 * — a real race condition, and plausibly part of what produced the
 * truncated Qwen downloads found earlier (two writers to one path).
 *
 * `startDownload` guards against exactly that: if a download for this
 * asset is already in flight, it returns the existing one instead of
 * starting a duplicate.

 * Refresh mid-download can leave a stale in-flight entry pointing at a
 * promise nothing will ever resolve, which `startDownload`'s "already
 * running" guard then treats as legitimately in progress forever. Unlike
 * `startDownload`, this doesn't check that guard — it clears the tracked
 * state unconditionally and cancels+deletes whatever ModelManager was
 * actually holding, then starts clean.
 *
 * Ordering matters: signal cancel, then AWAIT the stale in-flight promise's
 * settlement, and only then delete the file and start over. Deleting the
 * file right after signalling cancel (without waiting) races the old
 * download's writer, which doesn't stop touching the file the instant
 * pauseAsync() resolves — if it closes its stream after the new download
 * already finished, it silently truncates the file back down, and a fully-
 * downloaded model comes back verified as 0 bytes.
