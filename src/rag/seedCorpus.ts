 * Knowledge base sources, layered:
 *
 * 1. APP_TOPIC_DOCS — a handful of docs about the app's own architecture
 *    (useful for the bounty's own eval questions about MoE/mmap/RAM budgeting).
 * 2. minimumCorpus (assets/corpus/corpus.json) — 300 Wikipedia-derived docs,
 *    bundled directly in the JS bundle, always present, no download needed.
 * 3. Downloaded corpus packs (CORPUS_CATALOG entries, "standard"/"full"
 *    tiers) — read from disk if the user downloaded them via Settings or
 *    the first-run tier picker; skipped if not present.
 *
 * Called on every app start; each doc has a stable id so re-running only
 * inserts docs that aren't already in the DB (embedding is the expensive
 * part, so this avoids re-embedding everything just because a new corpus
 * pack was added later). Embeddings are computed on-device (not
 * precomputed at build/download time) so the vector index always matches
 * whatever embedding model actually ships.
